                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Maja! I'm 13 years old, currently in 8th grade, and attend McMillan Junior High School. I have three wonderful dogs that I love taking care of, cuddling with, and spending time with. I've always been passionate about dogs and enjoy helping them stay happy, healthy, and active.</p>

                    <h3>Why Choose Me?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Pet owners can trust me to be on time and take good care of their dogs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Experience:</strong> I currently have 3 dogs and have cared for others in the past, so I have great experience with older and younger dogs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fitness:</strong> I did gymnastics for 8 years, and now I do volleyball and dance, showing I have the energy and strength to care for your dog.</li>
                        <li><strong>Genuine Love for Dogs:</strong> I treat every dog as if they were my own, ensuring they feel happy and cared for.</li>
                    </ul>

        <h2>What Am I Doing This For?</h2>
        <p>I'm trying to get into side hustles to hopefully make some extra money to buy myself a couch for my room and other decoration items because I've been wanting to redecorate!</p>
        <h3>Additional</h3>
        <p>In addition to walking, I can assist with feeding, giving them water, or other light pet care duties while you're away.</p>
